LSM6DSO: IMU Sensor Monitor (I3C)
#################################

Overview
********
This sample sets the date rate of LSM6DSO accelerometer and gyroscope to
12.5Hz and enables a trigger on data ready. It displays on the console
the values for accelerometer and gyroscope.

Requirements
************

This sample uses the LSM6DSO sensor controlled using the I3C interface.
It has been tested using the LSM6DSO on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3`
connected to the I3C header on :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`.

Building and Running
********************

This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires an LSM6DSO
sensor (for example, the one on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3`).

.. note::

   If ``CONFIG_LSM6DSO_TRIGGER`` is enabled, the trigger is using
   I3C In-Band Interrupt (IBI) to signal new data being available.
   Since IBI is initiated by the sensor, it will take over the I3C
   bus. Therefore, when flashing a new image, a power cycle is needed
   to reset the sensor so that it will not generate IBIs anymore.
   Or else the I3C controller will not be able to be initialized,
   resulting in the sample not being able to communicate with
   the sensor.

Board Preparations
==================

mimxrt685_evk_cm33
------------------

On the board :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`, the I3C pins are exposed on the J18
header, where:

  * SCL is on pin 1
  * SDA is on pin 2
  * Internal pull-up is on pin 3 (which is connected to pin 2 already)
  * Ground is on pin4

Using Generic LSM6DSO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A LSM6DSO sensor needs to be connected to this header. For example,
the evaluation board STEVAL-MKI196V1 can be used. This needs to be
prepared so that the LSM6DSO sensor has address 0x6B (i.e. 0xD6,
left-shifed).

Using LSM6DSO on X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LSM6DSO on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3` can be used by plugging
the shield into the onboard Arduino header. Two jumper wires
are needed to connect the J18 header to the SCL/SDA pins on
the shield (J2, which is the I2C2 on shield). Do NOT connect pin 3
between these two headers. Note that with this setup, the I2C
controller must be disabled (by making sure ``CONFIG_I2C=n``) such that
only the I3C controller is driving the pins.

Note that the LPS22HH sensor on the shield does not support
dynamic address assignment (ENTDAA). Experiment said it actually
would interfere with the process. So it is required that it has
gone through SETDASA to set its dynamic address to its static
address before doing ENTDAA. Or simply do SETDASA for LSM6DSO too.
