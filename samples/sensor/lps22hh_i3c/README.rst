LPS22HH: Temperature and Pressure Monitor (I3C)
###############################################

Overview
********
This sample periodically reads pressure from the LPS22HH MEMS pressure
sensor and displays it on the console.

Requirements
************

This sample uses the LPS22HH sensor controlled using the I3C interface.
It has been tested using the LPS22HH on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3`
connected to the I3C header on :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`.

Building and Running
********************

This project outputs sensor data to the console. It requires an LPS22HH
sensor (for example, the one on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3`).

.. note::

   If ``CONFIG_LPS22HH_TRIGGER`` is enabled, the trigger is using
   I3C In-Band Interrupt (IBI) to signal new data being available.
   Since IBI is initiated by the sensor, it will take over the I3C
   bus. Therefore, when flashing a new image, a power cycle is needed
   to reset the sensor so that it will not generate IBIs anymore.
   Or else the I3C controller will not be able to be initialized,
   resulting in the sample not being able to communicate with
   the sensor.

Board Preparations
==================

mimxrt685_evk_cm33
------------------

On the board :ref:`mimxrt685_evk`, the I3C pins are exposed on the J18
header, where:

  * SCL is on pin 1
  * SDA is on pin 2
  * Internal pull-up is on pin 3 (which is connected to pin 2 already)
  * Ground is on pin4

Using Generic LPS22HH
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A LPS22HH sensor needs to be connected to this header. For example,
the evaluation board STEVAL-MKI196V1 can be used. This needs to be
prepared so that the LPS22HH sensor has address 0x5D (i.e. 0xBA,
left-shifed).

Using LPS22HH on X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LPS22HH on :ref:`x-nucleo-iks01a3` can be used by plugging
the shield into the onboard Arduino header. Two jumper wires
are needed to connect the J18 header to the SCL/SDA pins on
the shield (J2, which is the I2C2 on shield). Do NOT connect pin 3
between these two headers. Note that with this setup, the I2C
controller must be disabled (by making sure ``CONFIG_I2C=n``) such that
only the I3C controller is driving the pins.

Because the board has other I2C/I3C devices, it is a good idea to
make sure only the LPS22HH is the only sensor enabled by keeping
JP4 connected, but JP1, JP2, JP3, JP13 and JP14 disconnected.
